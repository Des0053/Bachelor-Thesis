Particle Acceleration In Compressing Plasmoids and Synchrotron Radiation

Unfortunately the full programs were lost. But parts of them showing the main algorithm were saved.
Each Matlab file contains the code computing the time evolution of the particles' Lorentz factors and of the systems distribution function, for different system conditions:
  1. Instant injection in a system where the electrons are only accelerated
  2. Continuous injection in a system where the electrons are only accelerated
  3. Instant injection in a system where the electrons are only decelerated by emmiting Synchrotron radiation 
  4. Continuous injection in a system where the electrons are only decelerated by emmiting Synchrotron radiation
  5. Instant injection in a system where the electrons are only decelerated by emmiting Synchrotron radiation 
  6. Continuous injection in a system where the electrons are only decelerated by emmiting Synchrotron radiation 
  
The last program computes the total power per frewuency emmited by the population on each time step.
